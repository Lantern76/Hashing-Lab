# Hashing-Lab
An entry level lab for those interested in learning more about hashing on both Windows and Linux systems. 

# As a disclaimer, it is highly recomended that this and any other labs, be conducted on a Virtual Machine with a known good backup!

# Windows-Linux-Hashing-Activity

## Objective

The Hashing Home Lab is designed to get individuals interested in the world of hashing and gain a foundation to which build upon for more advanced activitys. Hashing is when a mathematical algorithm is applied to digital data. It sereves as both a way of hiding and validating data. It can often be seen when storing passwords or when preserving data for forensic purposes. In this lab we will only be looking at two of the most basic forms of hash, MD5 and Sha-1. Thos following along will find and create hashes for data within their virtual system.

### Skills Learned

- Basic understanding of Hashing concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting Hashing types.
- Ability to utilize the GUI of the HashCalc Tool.
- Enhanced knowledge of both Windows and Linux terminals.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- HashCalc for creating and viewing multiple Hashes of data.
- Command Line tools(such as md5sum in Linux) for creating Hashes of desired data samples.
